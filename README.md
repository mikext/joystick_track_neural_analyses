<u>Pipeline</u>

- Feature Extraction based on signal processing

  1. Use the index or value of the First/Second/Third Largest Frequnency
  2. Use one/two/three Eigen vector generated by PCA to achieve dimension reduction
   
- Model fitting and selection
    1. Benchmark (method of the original paper) : Linear Regression
        - Dataset split
           - random K fold CV
           - time slices K fold CV
        - Features included
           - LMP only
           - LMP and power densities (raw)
           - LMP and power densities (selected)

    2. Apply Kalman Filter to decode kinematic parameters.
        - state variables
           - posX, posY
           - posX, posY, Vx, Vy
        - Dataset split
           - time slices K fold CV
        - Features included
           - LMP only
           - LMP and power densities (raw)
           - LMP and power densities (selected)

    3. (If time permits) Apply Kalman Filter to decode kinematic parameters on polar coordinates, e.g., phase, amplitude, angular velocity, angular acceleration.

        - state variables
           - amplitude, angular velocity, angular acceleration
        - Dataset split
           - time slices K fold CV
        - Features included
           - LMP only
           - LMP and power densities (raw)
           - LMP and power densities (selected)
