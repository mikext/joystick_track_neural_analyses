# Decode Two-dimensional Joystick Kinematics in Humans by ECoG Signals 

### ECE 209 Group Project 

*Xiaotian Wang, Yudi Wang*

<u>Approach</u>

- Benchmark (method of the original paper) : Linear Regression

- Feature Extraction based on signal processing

  1. Use the index or value of the First/Second/Third Largest Frequnency
  2. Use one/two/three Eigen vector generated by PCA to achieve dimension reduction

- Apply Kalman Filter to decode kinematic parameters of X, Y, Vx, Vy.

- (If time permits) Apply Kalman Filter to decode kinematic parameters on polar

  coordinates, e.g., phase, amplitude, angular velocity, angular acceleration.
